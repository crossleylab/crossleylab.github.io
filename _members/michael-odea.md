Michael completed a Bachelor of Advanced Science (Honours 1st Class) majoring in Genetics in 2022. He also completed a Bachelor of Computer Science at the same time, majoring in AI. He first joined the lab in 2018 during an undergraduate project and returned for a PhD after spending his Honours building machine learning models for breast cancer prediction in the Vafaee lab. His current research is focused on understanding the role that nucleosomes play in the repression of foetal haemoglobin, in the hopes that the answer could lead to advancements in the treatment of sickle cell disease. In his free time Michael enjoys solving puzzles, collecting fossils and good chats with friends (ideally over a coffee and pastry).
