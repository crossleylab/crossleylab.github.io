Eva completed a Bachelor’s degree in Biotechnology at the European University in Madrid in 2017, followed by a Master’s degree in Food Science at the University of Melbourne in 2019. After her Master’s, she joined Agriculture Victoria, where she studied the effects of elevated CO₂ and simulated future climate conditions on insect pests and grain production in Australia. She later made a significant career shift and spent 3.5 years at Vow, a cultured meat company, using CRISPR/Cas9 to develop immortalised and more nutritious cell lines. Through this work, she discovered a strong passion for genetics and the precise ways gene function can be modified, which led her to begin a PhD focused on mammalian gene regulation via transcription factors and protein interactions. In her spare time, Eva enjoys exercising, going to the beach, cooking, and recently, reading.
