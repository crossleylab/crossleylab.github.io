Emmaline completed a Bachelor of Science (Catalyst Program) majoring in Genetics at the University of Tasmania in 2022. She joined the lab in 2023 and is currently completing her Honours year. Emmaline's project investigates the role of adipose tissue resident eosinophils in beiging. She aims to develop an assay for identifying novel eosinophil-derived proteins, which represent promising targets for anti-obesity therapies. In her spare time, Emmaline enjoys snacking, watching period dramas and exploring Sydney.
