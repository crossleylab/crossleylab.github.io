Sonia completed a Bachelor of Advanced Science (Honours) majoring in Molecular and Cell Biology in 2020. She joined the lab for honours (First Class) and continued on to complete her PhD. Sonia's research focuses on the effect of DNA methylation on transcription factor binding in red blood cells. Her work explores how stem cell fate is determined and the role of methylation in regulating erythropoiesis. Sonia has a strong passion for clear scientific communication and medically applied research, having also worked in clinical trials targeting Alzheimer's disease for over 5 years. In her spare time you'll find Sonia on a hiking trail, rollerskating and painting, though usually not all at once.
